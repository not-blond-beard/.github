 Hi there 👋!

We are a small Unity game development team that gathered to make fun games. 😎

All of our team members are beginners who are not familiar with game development.
However, even if it is clumsy and slow, it is steadily developing and enjoying game production.

Every code is managed as an 📂 open source. 

There is still a lot of content in development, but contribution is always welcome, so please take good care of us! 👊🏻
